## About
This is a blog-style website documenting my 2024 paddleboarding trips. The site foundation is WordPress, and the design is implemented using custom CSS.

This was completed as my final project for the Web Design (MDST-3610) course. The project included developing design materials - available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ag7Y8JcVuStM3l5Sf4rex3FMzwlzGmAg) - including a user persona and design brief (site purpose, target audience, website scope, mockups, and style guide).
